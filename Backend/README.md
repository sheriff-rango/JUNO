A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications. This boilerplate gives the basic stucture of application start with while bundling enough useful features so as to remove all those redundant tasks that can derail a project before it even really gets started. This boilerplate users Express with sequelize as ORM and MySQL as database.

2. Change directory to your project folder `cd <your_project_folder_name>`
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Create database in MySQL.
5. Update the your database name and credentials in the `.env` file.
